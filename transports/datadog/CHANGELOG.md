## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-03

### Patch Changes

- Republish every module to ship a clean `go.mod` to the Go module proxy.

  The v2.0.0 cascade and the subsequent `transports/cli` v2.1.0 release shipped sub-module `go.mod` files containing dev-only `replace go.loglayer.dev/v2 => ../..` directives and placeholder pseudo-version requires (`v2.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000`). Downstream consumers who depended on any sub-module saw `go mod tidy` 404 on the placeholder.

  monorel v0.9.0 ([disaresta-org/monorel#42](https://github.com/disaresta-org/monorel/pull/42)) added a release-time `go.mod` cleaner that strips the dev-only sibling replaces and pins sibling requires to the planned release version. This release republishes every affected module with the cleaned `go.mod`.

  No API changes. Re-`go get` to pick up the cleaned modules.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-02

### Major Changes

- **Breaking: import paths bump to `/v2`.** The loglayer core no longer folds the `WithPrefix` value into `Messages[0]`; the prefix flows through `TransportParams.Prefix` and each transport renders it. Built-in transports preserve their prior user-visible output via the new `transport.JoinPrefixAndMessages` helper. The `cli` transport opts into smart rendering (dim-grey user prefix separate from level color).

  See [Migrating to v2](https://go.loglayer.dev/migrating-to-v2) for the upgrade checklist.

### Features

* Surface assembly Schema to transports and plugins, add Sentry transport ([#24](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer-go/issues/24)) ([d35a0d5](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer-go/commit/d35a0d5146e704d92f65fb208b17daaa4d151891))

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer-go/compare/transports/datadog/v1.0.0...transports/datadog/v1.1.0) (2026-04-29)

No code changes in this module. v1.1.0 was a coordinated tag created alongside the main `go.loglayer.dev` v1.1.0 release; see the [main CHANGELOG](https://github.com/loglayer/loglayer-go/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#110-2026-04-29) for the post-launch reshuffle that drove the bump.
