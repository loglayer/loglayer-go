# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-02

### Major Changes

- **Breaking: import paths bump to `/v2`.** The loglayer core no longer folds the `WithPrefix` value into `Messages[0]`; the prefix flows through `TransportParams.Prefix` and each transport renders it. Built-in transports preserve their prior user-visible output via the new `transport.JoinPrefixAndMessages` helper. The `cli` transport opts into smart rendering (dim-grey user prefix separate from level color).

  See [Migrating to v2](https://go.loglayer.dev/migrating-to-v2) for the upgrade checklist.
